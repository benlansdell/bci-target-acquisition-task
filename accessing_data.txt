Cheat sheet for accessing Charlie’s data:

All the data from a single day is first broken down into sessions. For example, one session might be manual control, another brain control, etc.
Each session is broken down into trials. Each trial corresponds to the monkey performing one task (e.g., using brain control to move the cursor to a target -> when the target position changes, a new trial starts).

The data for a single session is split among three types of files:

    .mat file → contains data recorded with labview
    	 in /labview/Moritz Primate MAT Files 2012-2013
	 Unlike the .nev and .ns3 files, all data for a single day is contained in a single file.
	 Each data file contains a struct called data. In most of the .mat files, this struct will have a field called .nev: this tells you whether each .nev and .ns3 file was manual, brain control, velocity, position, etc.
	 The .mat file only contains spike data for the four neurons selected to record from during the day.

    .nev file: contains all raw spike data from all neurons (recorded with blackrock)
    	 in /blackrock directory
	 open with openNEV(‘fullpathfilename.nev’,‘read’)
	 NEV.Data.Spikes contains time and electrode of each spike
     	 The data for a single day is split up into multiple files. Roughly, each file corresponds to a change in the experimental paradigm.

    .ns3 file → contains all raw LFP from all neurons and torque data (recored with blackrock)
    	 in /blackrock directory
	 Everything in NS3.Data
	 1-96 contra
	 97-128 ipsi
	 138-139 torque channels
         The files for a single day are organized in the same way the .nev files are. There should be the same number of ns3 files as nev files for a given day.

All meta data about trials (target positions, start positions, times of trials, etc.) contained in Spanky_LogMetaData-test.mat, which contains a struct called metaData.

Details of what each field in each file means, and how to use them

.mat file

     - All data in specific file, e.g., Spanky_2013-01-17-1325.mat, is stored in struct called data.
     - Sample rate = 60 Hz (time stamps in units of 1/60s)

     data.stateHist: contains data for entire day sampled as lab-view sampling rate (60Hz)

         data.stateHist.spikes: near-binary (sometimes there is more than one) spike-time vector; first 4 columns are spikes from the
	 data.stateHist.time: time-vector (in seconds)
	 data.stateHist.lag: lag
	 data.stateHist.cursor: cursor position (the thing the monkey's moving)
	 data.stateHist.error: displacement between target and cursor
	 data.stateHist.valid: binary vector indicating whether each trial was valid

    data.filters: some kind of filters

    data.messages: contains all messages associated with trials (including marking what kind of task is being done)

    data.trials: parameters for each trial of the day
        
        data.trials.time: end time of each trial
        data.trials.index: index of each trial
	data.trials.start_pos: starting cursor position for each trial
	data.trials.duration: duration of each trial
	data.trials.targ: where target was for each trial
	data.trials.threshold: how close cursor had to get to target to count as success
	data.trials.success: whether monkey moved cursor to target successfully or not
	data.trials.valid: whether trial was valid or not

    data.nev: info about how to line up .nev and .mat file, parameters of each session (brain control, manual control, etc.)

        data.nev.Toffset: offset between .mat file and .nev file time-stamps (in units of 1/60s); to get offset in seconds: data.nev(idx).Toffset/60. Add this to spike-times in .nev file.
	data.nev.chans: which channels were used during each session; integer component: which channel; decimal: code indicating algorithm for spike-sorting, etc.
	data.nev.idxSet: indices of trials associated with each session
	data.nev.map: whether manual, brain, position, velocity, etc.
